# Workshop #2: References, Dynamic Memory, Function Overloading

This is second work that I have done using C++ language in Second semester at Seneca college.

In this workshop, I used File scope variables, 
Reuse my previously developed modules and overload functions, Dynamically allocate, reallocate (resize) and deallocate (free) memory.
