# Workshop #9: Derived Classes and Resources

This is ninth work that I have done using C++ language in Second semester at Seneca college.

In this workshop, I completed two classes:
- **Text:** A class that can read the contents of a text file into memory and insert it into ostream.
- **HtmlText**: A **Text** Class that has a title and can insert the text contents of the class into ostream in simple HTML format.
