# Workshop #7: Derived Classes

This is seventh work that I have done using C++ language in Second semester at Seneca college.

In this workshop, I worked with classes that make up a hierarchical structure. 
The base or parent class will be called `Container` that encapsulates a Container with a specific capacity in CCs, 
then the child class `Pack` that is a Container of several smaller units (like 24 Cans of soup or 12 bottles of Wine).
