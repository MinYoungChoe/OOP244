# Workshop #8: Virtual functions and Abstract base classes

This is eighth work that I have done using C++ language in Second semester at Seneca college.

In this workshop, I created a hierarchy of classes to practice and understand the role of virtual functions in inheritance. 

The work consists of 4 classes:  
- Shape; encapsulates a shape that can be drawn on the screen<br />
(An interface, that is an abstract base class with only pure virtual functions)
- LblShape; encapsulates a shape that can be labelled <br />
(An abstract base class that represents a labelled shape) 
- Line; encapsulates a horizontal line on a screen with the label <br />
(this concrete class draws a labelled line)
- Rectangle; encapsulates a rectangle on the screen that can be labelled <br />
(this concrete class draws a rectangle with a label inside).
